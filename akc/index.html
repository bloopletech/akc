      <p>ArrowKeyControl is a reaction testing game that tests your speed and concentration.</p>
      <p>You have to type what you see: up, down, left, or right arrow. Get it wrong and it's game over.</p>
      <p>You have 1.1 seconds to hit the first key, and every time you hit a key, the time allowed to hit the next key
        decreases. The game continues like this as long as you press each key fast enough;
        too slow and the game ends.</p>
